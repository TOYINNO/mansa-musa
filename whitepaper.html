            <h2>Whitepaper</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the world of Mansa Musa ($MANSA), a revolutionary meme
              coin built on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the legendary
              wealth of Mansa Musa, the richest man in history, $MANSA aims to
              bring unprecedented prosperity and excitement to the crypto
              ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
              Mansa Musa, the 14th-century emperor of the Mali Empire, is
              renowned for his immense wealth and generosity. His pilgrimage to
              Mecca in 1324, accompanied by a lavish display of gold and riches,
              left a lasting impression on the world. Today, $MANSA seeks to
              channel the spirit of Mansa Musa, bringing back his legacy of
              wealth and abundance to the modern age.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as Mansa Musa's wealth transformed the regions he traveled
              through, $MANSA is poised to bring disruptive and transformative
              wealth into the crypto ecosystem. By leveraging the power of
              community and the efficiency of the Solana blockchain, $MANSA aims
              to create a thriving and vibrant economy that rewards its holders
              and participants.
            </p>

            <h3>Tokenomics</h3>
            <p>
              The tokenomics of $MANSA are designed to ensure fair distribution,
              robust marketing, team incentives, and smooth exchange listing.

              rapid growth in our community and market presence.
            </p>

            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure sustained growth and visibility, 2% of the total supply
              is allocated for marketing efforts. This will cover various
              initiatives, including social media campaigns, influencer

              Recognizing the importance of a motivated and dedicated team, 2%
              of the total supply is reserved for the core team. These tokens
              will serve as incentives to ensure the team's commitment to the
              project's long-term success and continuous development.
            </p>
